This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You should see `[car-discovery] run-dev.mjs: port 3000, ...` and then Next.js on **port 3000**. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

**If you see port 3003 or "Failed to proxy" / "middleware deprecated":** the running process was started with an old config. Stop it (Ctrl+C), then start again from the project root.

**To force the correct dev server (bypasses npm/IDE):** in a **new** terminal, from the project root run:
```bash
node scripts/run-dev.mjs
```
You must see `[car-discovery] run-dev.mjs: port 3000, ...` and `Local: http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Then open http://localhost:3000. If your IDE keeps starting an old command, use this in a separate terminal instead of the IDE’s Run button.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
